      "title": "Add password visibility toggle to auth forms",
      "description": "Add a show/hide password toggle button inside the password input field on login, signup, and forgot-password pages to allow users to reveal their password temporarily.",
      "rationale": "Password visibility toggles are a modern UX standard that reduce typing errors and improve accessibility. Currently, users cannot verify what they're typing in password fields, leading to potential login failures and frustration. This is especially critical on mobile where typing errors are common.",

      "current_state": "Password inputs use type='password' without any visibility toggle. The login page (line 122-126) and signup page (line 156-163) both render plain password inputs. Users must type their password blindly with no way to verify what they entered. The Input component is a simple wrapper around the native input element without any built-in icon slot.",
      "proposed_change": "1. Create a new PasswordInput component that wraps Input with a toggle button using Eye/EyeSlash icons from @phosphor-icons/react. 2. Add relative positioning to the input wrapper with the toggle button positioned at right-3. 3. Toggle between type='password' and type='text' on click. 4. Add proper ARIA attributes (aria-pressed, aria-label='Show password'/'Hide password'). 5. Replace password Input with PasswordInput in login page (line 122) and signup page (line 158). 6. Ensure the toggle button doesn't submit the form (type='button').",

      "rationale": "Many icon buttons across the UI (DotsThreeVertical menus, SidebarTrigger, action buttons) lack tooltips, making them difficult to understand without clicking. Users encountering icon-only buttons need hover hints to understand functionality.",

      "proposed_change": "1. Import Tooltip, TooltipTrigger, TooltipContent from components/ui/tooltip.tsx. 2. Wrap icon buttons consistently: a) DotsThreeVertical buttons -> 'More options', b) SidebarTrigger -> 'Toggle sidebar', c) Plus buttons -> 'Add new...', d) CaretUpDown -> 'Switch workspace', e) Drag handles -> 'Drag to reorder'. 3.

      "rationale": "Current empty states are plain text messages (e.g., 'No tasks', 'No clients found', 'No workstreams defined yet').

ProjectTasksTab (line 113-115) shows 'No tasks defined yet' in a minimal dashed border. QuickLinksCard (line 32) shows 'No files' with a basic icon.",
      "proposed_change": "1. Create a reusable EmptyState component with props for: icon (Phosphor icon), title, description, action (optional button). 2. Add larger icons (48px) with muted-foreground color in a subtle circular background. 3. Use more descriptive copy: Instead of 'No tasks' use 'No tasks yet - Create your first task to get started'. 4. Include primary action button when appropriate. 5. Match the pattern from project-cards-view.tsx empty state. 6. Apply consistently to all empty state locations.",

Create app/clients/loading.tsx mirroring the table structure from clients-content.tsx: header skeleton, filter pills skeleton, table rows (8) with avatar placeholder (h-8 w-8), text placeholders for each column. 2. Create app/tasks/loading.tsx with skeleton cards in a grid layout matching TaskWeekBoardView column structure. 3. Use the existing Skeleton component pattern: bg-accent animate-pulse rounded-md. 4.
