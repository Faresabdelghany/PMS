      "description": "Ensure ProjectCard, TaskBoardCard, and other custom interactive elements have consistent and visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation, following the Button component pattern.",
      "rationale": "While Button and Input components have proper focus-visible styles, custom interactive elements use 'focus:outline-none' which removes the default focus indicator without providing a custom one. This hurts keyboard accessibility and violates WCAG 2.4.7.",

      "current_state": "ProjectCard (line 112) has 'focus:outline-none' in className with no replacement focus style. TaskBoardCard (line 55) has 'focus:outline-none' on the card div. Both have tabIndex={0} and role='button' indicating they're keyboard accessible, but pressing Tab gives no visual indication of focus. Verified by grep - no 'focus-visible:ring' exists in these components.",
      "proposed_change": "1. Update ProjectCard className (line 112) from 'cursor-pointer focus:outline-none' to 'cursor-pointer focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2'. 2. Update TaskBoardCard className (line 55) similarly. 3. For cards with existing borders, consider 'focus-visible:border-primary focus-visible:ring-1 focus-visible:ring-primary/20' for a subtler effect. 4. Test keyboard navigation flow through all interactive elements to ensure focus is always visible.",

      "proposed_change": "1. Import Tooltip, TooltipTrigger, TooltipContent from components/ui/tooltip.tsx. 2. Wrap icon buttons consistently: a) CaretUpDown (app-sidebar.tsx line 201) -> 'Switch workspace', b) ProjectHeaderActions buttons -> 'Copy link', 'Share', 'More actions', c) Drag handles -> 'Drag to reorder', d) Plus buttons -> 'Add new task/item'. 3.

Update app-sidebar.tsx kbd element to conditionally render: {isMac ? '\u2318' : 'Ctrl+'}K. 3.
